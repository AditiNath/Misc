1. getwd()
returns the path for current working directory
[if you want to change directory]
go to files --> change dir

2.loading source into R
a. file-> new script; new window pops up; write code
b. copy it and paste into R console, function is loaded into R
c. now if command ls() is used it will show function name
d. call the function

2.loading source into R(from file)
a. file-> new script; new window pops up; write code
b. save it into the working directory of R
c. type dir() into the console, it will show the name of the files
d. type source(filename.R)
e. type ls() --> it will show the name of the functions of filename.R

3.things we type in R prompt --> called expression
x <- 1
print(x)
output: [1] 1
[1] indicates that x is a vector and 5 is the first element

4. : operator is used for sequence
x <- 1:20  #print 1 to 20
print (x)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
[16] 16 17 18 19 20

5.c() function can be used to create vectors of objects
x <- c(0.5, 0.6)
x <- vector("numeric" , length = 10)
print (x)
[1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  #initializes them to zero

5. vector - elements are  of the same class
if two elements are different, then they are coerced into one class
example 
x <- (1, "a") # it will convert x into a character vector ("1", "a")

list - elements can be of different class
elements are indexed by double brackets
