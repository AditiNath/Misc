Whenever you're working with a new dataset, the first thing you should do is
look at it! What is the format of the data? What are the dimensions? What are
the variable names? How are the variables stored? Are there missing data? Are
there any flaws in the data?

class(x)
-class describes the typep of x: matrix, dataframe, list or vector etc

dim(x)
-dimension of x; how many rows and colmns

nrow(x)/ncol(x)
-number of rows/colmns in x

object.size(x)
-how much space dataset x is occupying in memory

names(x)
-returns a character vector of colm(i.e.variable name) names

head(x)
-returns the first 6 rows of dataset x by default

head(x, nrow)
-returns the nrow of dataset x

tail(x)/tail(x, nrow)
-returns data from the last

summary(x)
-provides different output for each variable, depending on its class

table(x$col_name)
-how many times each value of 'col_name' occurs in the data

str(x)
-gives the detailed structure of x

A %in% B
checks if A is in B; A- value to be checked, B-value to be checked against
example- 1:10 %in% c(1,3,5,9)
output- TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
